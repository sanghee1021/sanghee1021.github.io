## Welcome

Welcome to Sanghee Moon's homepage. I am a Ph.D. candidate (defending soon! July 9th, 2019) in rehabilitation science at University of Kansas Medical Center. I love to talk any topics in rehabilitation science, physical therapy, clinical neurology, neuroscience, biomechanics, kinesiology, biochemistry, molecular biology, computer, machine learning, and artificial intelligence.

If you want to see my publications, [click here](./posts/index_example.md)! I also try to keep recording things happening around and discuss thoughts and ideas: [Sanghee's blog](./posts/index_example.md).
